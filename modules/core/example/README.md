# BitGoJS Examples

## `ts` directory

In this directory, you can find examples on how to use the BitGoJS SDK with Typescript. These examples use modern Typescript/ES6 syntax with `async`/`await`. This is the recommended way to use the BitGoJS SDK for new projects.

## `js` directory

In this directory, you can find examples on how to use the BitGoJS SDK with Javascript. These examples use coroutine syntax with `yield`.

## `v1` directory

In this directory, you can find example on how to use the Version 1 BitGoJS SDK API with Javascript. These examples are for our deprecated v1 platform, and should not be followed for new code. They are included here for historical reasons and will be removed in the future. These examples use the older node callback syntax to handle asynchronous behavior.
